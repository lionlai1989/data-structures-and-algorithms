This repository hosts materials for the course, [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization, offered by Coursera and UC San Diego](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms), including my own solutions to the problems and personal notes accumulated during the course.


## Description
This Specialization explores fundamental in data structures and algorithms and is divided into six series courses, each offering thorough explanation and unique insights into this dynamic field.

- [Algorithmic Toolbox]():


- [Data Structures]():


- [Algorithms on Graphs]():


- [Algorithms on Strings]():
