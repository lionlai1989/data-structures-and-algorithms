# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository hosts materials for the course,
[Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms),
offered by Coursera and UC San Diego, including my own solutions to the problems.

## Description

This specialization explores fundamental in data structures and algorithms and is
divided into six series courses:

### [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C1-Algorithmic_Toolbox):

The initial course covers algorithmic strategies, including greedy algorithms,
divide-and-conquer algorithms, and dynamic programming. These three techniques are
better described as strategic approaches rather than specific algorithms. The principles
underlying these strategies are readily observable in more specialized algorithms. For
instance, merge sort exemplifies the divide-and-conquer algorithm, and dynamic
programming can be applied to solve problems like finding the shortest path in an
undirected graph.

### [Data Structures](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C2-Data_Structures):

The second course, Data Structures, is the **cornerstone** of this specialization. To
harness the full potential of effective algorithms, efficient data structures for data
manipulation are indispensable. Among these, arrays and singly/doubly linked lists
represent two _concrete_ data structures. At the same time, there are many _abstract_
data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, disjoint sets, hash tables, and
binary trees. This course dives into the comprehensive theory and implementation of both
_concrete_ and _abstract_ data structures, offering insights into their strengths and
weaknesses and guidance on when to deploy them in various contexts.

### [Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C3-Algorithms_on_Graphs):

_Graph theory_ is a mathematical discipline that studies graph structures comprised of
vertices connected by edges. Its significance extends to diverse fields, like computer
science, cryptography, logistics, transportation, urban planning, and economics. This
course introduces fundamental graph theory concepts, including identifying strongly
connected components, finding shortest paths, and determining minimum spanning trees.

### [Algorithms on Strings](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C4-Algorithms_on_Strings):

## Getting Started

In this repository, all data structures and algorithms are developed from scratch. There
is no requirement to install any additional dependencies; all you need is a **Python3**
or **C++** compiler installed on your system.

## Help

Any feedback, comments, and questions are welcome.
