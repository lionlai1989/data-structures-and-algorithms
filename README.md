# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my study notes on the course,
[Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms),
offered by Coursera and UC San Diego.

## Description

This specialization explores fundamental in data structures and algorithms and is
divided into six series courses:

### [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C1-Algorithmic_Toolbox):

- Greedy Algorithm
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming

### [Data Structures](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C2-Data_Structures):
<!-- 
- Concrete data structures: arrays and linked lists
- Abstract data structures: stacks, queues, priority queues, disjoint sets, hash
  tables, and binary trees.

The second course, Data Structures, is the **cornerstone** of this specialization. To
harness the full potential of effective algorithms, efficient data structures for data
manipulation are indispensable. Among these, arrays and singly/doubly linked lists
represent two _concrete_ data structures. At the same time, there are many _abstract_
data structures such as stacks, queues, priority queues, disjoint sets, hash tables, and
binary trees. This course dives into the comprehensive theory and implementation of both
_concrete_ and _abstract_ data structures, offering insights into their strengths and
weaknesses and guidance on when to deploy them in various contexts. -->

### [Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C3-Algorithms_on_Graphs):
<!-- 
- strongly connected components
- shortest paths
- minimum spanning trees

_Graph theory_ is a mathematical discipline that studies graph structures comprised of
vertices connected by edges. Its significance extends to diverse fields, like computer
science, cryptography, logistics, transportation, urban planning, and economics. This
course introduces fundamental graph theory concepts, including identifying strongly
connected components, finding shortest paths, and determining minimum spanning trees. -->

### [Algorithms on Strings](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C4-Algorithms_on_Strings):

## Getting Started

In this repository, all data structures and algorithms are developed from scratch. There
is no requirement to install any additional dependencies; all you need is a
**C++** compiler installed on your system.
