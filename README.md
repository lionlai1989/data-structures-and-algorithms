# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository hosts materials for the course,
[Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms),
offered by Coursera and UC San Diego, including my own solutions to the problems.

## Description

This specialization explores fundamental in data structures and algorithms and is
divided into six series courses:

### [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C1-Algorithmic_Toolbox):

The initial course covers algorithmic strategies, including greedy algorithms,
divide-and-conquer algorithms, and dynamic programming. These three techniques are
better described as strategic approaches rather than specific algorithms. The principles
underlying these strategies are readily observable in more specialized algorithms. For
instance, merge sort exemplifies the divide-and-conquer algorithm, and dynamic
programming can be applied to solve problems like finding the shortest path in an
undirected graph.

### [Data Structures](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C2-Data_Structures):

To maximize the potential of good algorithms, it's essential to have efficient data
structures for data manipulation. In this course, I dive into various data structures,
including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, disjoint-sets, hash
tables, and binary search trees, gaining a comprehensive understanding of their
strengths and weaknesses and when to employ each of them.

### [Algorithms on Graphs](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C3-Algorithms_on_Graphs):

Graph theory is a mathematical discipline focusing on the study of graphsâ€”structures
comprised of vertices connected by edges. Its significance extends to diverse fields,
like computer science, cryptography, logistics, transportation, urban planning, and
economics. This course provides an introduction to fundamental graph theory concepts,
including identifying strongly connected components, finding shortest paths, and
determining minimum spanning trees.

### [Algorithms on Strings](https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/C4-Algorithms_on_Strings):

## Getting Started

In this repository, all data structures and algorithms are developed from scratch. There
is no requirement to install any additional dependencies; all you need is a **Python3**
or **C++** compiler installed on your system.

## Help

Any feedback, comments, and questions are welcome.
