# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository hosts materials for the course, [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms), offered by Coursera and UC San Diego, including my own solutions to the problems.


## Description
This Specialization explores fundamental in data structures and algorithms and is divided into six series courses, each offering thorough explanation and unique insights into this dynamic field.

- [Algorithmic Toolbox]():


- [Data Structures]():


- [Algorithms on Graphs]():


- [Algorithms on Strings]():


## Getting Started
All the results in this repository can be reproduced by following the instructions below.

### System Dependencies
Before you start, you need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* **Python-3.10**:
* **C++**:


### Downloading
* To download this repository, run the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lionlai1989/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
```

### Install Dependencies
#### Python
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```
python3.10 -m venv venv_algorithms && source venv_algorithms/bin/activate
```
- Update `pip` and `setuptools`:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```
- Install required Python packages in `requirements.txt`.
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### C++
#### Rust

### Running Code
Now you are ready to run the code of each programming language.

#### Python
Please remember to select the kernel you just created in your virtual environment `venv_deep_learning`.
```python
python3
```

#### C++
```cpp
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=c++11
```

#### Rust
