# Data Structures

## Description

This section provides a brief overview of the course content for each week.

-   Week 1: Basic Data Structures

    Arrays and linked lists serve as fundamental building blocks for data storage in
    computers, and there's no any other option. In this introduction, we'll explore the
    pros and cons of both arrays and singly/doubly linked lists. Later, we'll dive into
    abstract data structures, stacks (First In, Last Out) and queues (First In, First
    Out). The choice between array-based and linked list-based implementations of stacks
    and queues depends on specific application needs. Some applications may prefer
    arrays, while others may opt for linked lists. Finally, we'll offer a brief overview
    of binary trees.

-   Week 2: Dynamic Arrays and Amortized Analysis

    As introduced in week 1, primitive arrays have a fixed size. To overcome this
    limitation, we can employ an abstraction data type called a dynamic array, which
    allows for resizable arrays, offering greater convenience. To my surprise, both
    C++'s `std::vector` and Python's `list` rely on resizable dynamic arrays as their
    underlying implementations, rather than linked lists. Dynamic arrays must
    periodically resize themselves, necessitating the copying of n elements to a new
    array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n) for this operation. However, the
    amortized cost for each insert operation remains constant at O(1).

-   Week 3: Priority Queues and Disjoint Sets

    Priority queues is an abstract data type where each element is assigned a priority,
    and elements are extracted in order based on their priority. In C++, you can use
    `priority_queue`, while in Python, `heapq` serves this purpose. Priority queues can
    be implemented using arrays, linked lists, but are most commonly implemented with
    tree-structured binary min/max heaps, where the insertion and extraction of min/max
    values have a time complexity of $O(log(n))$.

    Disjoint sets, on the other hand, offer solutions to various practical problems,
    such as finding a path from an entrance to an exit in a maze or determining the
    number of connected components in a graph, particularly useful for addressing
    graph-related challenges. Typically, disjoint sets are implemented using linked
    list-based tree structures, providing an amortized constant cost of $O(log^*(n))$
    for a single operation. It's important to highlight that for any practical value of
    (n), even as large as $2^{65536}$, the value of $log^*(n)$ remains less than 5.

-   Week 4: Hash Tables

    An implementation of a **Set** or a **Map** using hashing is commonly referred to as
    a hash table. In C++, you can use `unordered_set` for **Set** and `unordered_map`
    for **Map**, while in Python, `set` serves as **Set**, and `dict` is used for
    **Map**. Hash tables have a memory consumption cost of $O(n + m)$ and an operation
    cost of $O(c + 1)$, where:

    -   $n$ represents the number of objects,
    -   $m$ is the cardinality of the hash function, and
    -   $c$ denotes the longest chain length.
