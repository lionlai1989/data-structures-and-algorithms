# Algorithmic Toolbox

## Description

This section provides a concise summary of each assignment in the course, accompanied by brief descriptions and a few figures.

- Week 1: Programming Challenges  
  Finish all problems.

- Week 2: Algorithmic Warm-Up  
  Finished the problems 1 to 4. The problems 5 to 8 is too hard.  

- Week 3: Greedy Algorithms  
  Not all problems can be solved by greedy algorithms. So, make sure the first safe choice is optimal choice. Then you can continue. If not, then greedy algorithm is probably not the way to go.  
  Finished the problems 1 to 3. The problems 4 to 7 is too hard.

- Week 4: Divide-and-Conquer  
  binary search, selection sort, merge sort, non-counting sort, quick sort. Finsih the problems from 1 to 3. The problems 4 to 7 is too hard.

- Week 5: Dynamic Programming 1  
  Finish problems 1 to 3. 

- Week 6: Dynamic Programming 2  
  Finish problems 1 and 3.
